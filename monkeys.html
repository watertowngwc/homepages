Hi, world!
Hello, I love monkeys, and I have been obsessed with them, since Curious George

   I think that monkey biology is also really cool. If you like realustic fiction and you are interested in bonobo biology check out this book

 I think that everyone should love monkeys, and save them from extinction. My favorite websites that tell you about saving primates are Save The CHimps, Jane Goodall Instutite and CHhimp Havan.
Also research the "Trimates" a group made up of Birute Galdikas, Dian Fossey, and I totally recommend checking out their websites her are some things that we can do to help(August 2006) The chimpanzees of Gombe National Park in Kigoma Region, Tanzania, have come under increased pressure from four decades of high human population growth in the region and an associated increase in human activity and disease. The result has been a steady decline in the chimpanzee population residing in Tanzania's smallest national park, from 150 chimpanzees in the 1960s to about 90 today (see Why the Chimpanzees of Gombe National Park Are in Jeopardy).


1.Limiting the number of tourists each day who are allowed to observe chimpanzees;
2.Addressing the health and livelihood needs of local communities through community development projects;
3.Conducting conservation outreach and education programs; and
4.Maintaining ongoing scientific research efforts.
Also I want to address an common question "What is the difference between Chimpanzees and Bonobos?"
Here is what a bonobo looks like:
