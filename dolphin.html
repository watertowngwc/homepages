<body> If I were any animal for a week, I would be a dolphin. Dolphins are ridiculously smart, and I would kill to be that smart. Also, everyone loves them and they're cool. Dolphins don't have to worry about things like homework and grades and stuff. All they have to do is swim around and make sure they survive. They also look pretty great. Their fins are kind of awesome. </body>
